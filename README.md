# advent_of_code

These are my solutions for each year of advent of code. I try to use a different language each year to try and learn or improve upon a language that I know.

Below is a list of year -> language in the order I completed them starting with 2023 when I began solving advent of code

1. 2023 -> Go (some python when I thought the solution would take to long to write)
