This was my very first attempt at solving advent of code. I was learning Go at the time so it seemed like the best choice for both learning and solving things. However, if I did get stuck I would switch to python to get a quick answer. 

You can actually see me get better at organizing and solving problems as the days went on; particularly, in not having to rewrite things for part2 of the questions.

I tried my best to build my own data structures, but as I got further into it I couldn't spare the time.
